#Write a Python program that performs the following operations and prints the results

# Addition

# Subtraction

# Multiplication

# Division (float result)

# Floor Division (integer result)

# Modulus (remainder)

a = 10
b = 5

# Addition
addition = a + b 
print(f"Addition: {a}+{b} ={addition}")

# Subtraction
subtraction = a - b
print(f"Subtraction: {a}-{b} ={subtraction}")

# Multiplication
multiplication = a * b
print(f"Multiplication: {a}*{b} ={multiplication}") 

# Division (float result)
division = a / b
print(f"Division: {a}/{b} ={division}")

# Floor Division (integer result)
floor_division = a // b
print(f"Floor Division: {a}//{b} ={floor_division}")

# Modulus (remainder)
modulus = a % b
print(f"Modulus: {a}%{b} ={modulus}")
